# achieve

A terminal tool for managing tasks.

Developers are meant to live on terminal, because what they truly care is data, not those flashy bloat ui, widgets, useless info...

Jira is too complex.
Trello, Notion may be suitable for normal users, but not for develpers valuing more on efficiency and focus.
Asana, I don't like its 3-level vetical infomation achitecture, making things that could be simple more complicated. Plus, it's not free.

Those are just my personal opinion. Since I counldn't find a preferable tool to meet my needs, I decicded to design and develop one from scratch.

I'm working on the following right now:

    [w] ACHIEVE
      - [f] establish local db using sqlite *** [ ]
      - [f] draw terminal dashboard *** [ ]
      - [f] enable mouse action on the dashboard *** [ ]
      - [f] unicode and emoji support * [ ]
      - [f] color and font size support * [ ]
      - [f] project and task sort algorithems * [ ]
      - [f] data stattistics * [ ]

`go run ./cmd/achieve` in the project folder to check its current features and appearance.

As first stage, it's intended to be used for single user.
