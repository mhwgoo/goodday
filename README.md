# achieve

A terminal tool for managing tasks.

It's under development. But it works well by running `go run ./cmd/achiever`

I'm currently working on the following features:

    - store and read data locally using sqlite
    - get terminal args
    - read in several lines each day of a file content like hard lessons, mottos, etc.
