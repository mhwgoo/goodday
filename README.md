# goodday

A terminal tool for managing tasks to make our day good.

Developers are meant to live on terminal, because what they truly care is data, not bloated UI.

Jira is too complex.
Trello, Notion may be suitable for normal users, but not for developers valuing more on efficiency and focus.
Asana, I don't like its 3-level information architecture, making things that could be simple more complicated. Plus, it's not free.

Those are just my personal opinion. Since I could not find a preferable tool to meet my needs, I decided to build one from scratch.

`go run ./cmd/gd` in the project folder to check its current features and appearance.

As first stage, it's intended to be used for single user.
