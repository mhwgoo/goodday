# achieve

A terminal tool for managing personal tasks.

It's under development. But it still works well by running `go run main.go`

Though it is pretty small right now, it helps me manage my day-to-day tasks a lot.

I'm currently working on the following features:
    - get terminal args
    - store data locally
    - read in several lines each day of a file content like hard lessons, mottos, etc.
    - and more.
